This is a normal text. And you know it.

###(id=level3) Level 3, section

This is another normal text and paragraph. But with a [inline link](http://altenwald.com) and [reference to level 2](#level2) and a blind reference to [[#level3]].

When we are talking about a book like [JB98], that should be defined outside. A footnote is created like this^(A normal footnote which could be opened as a normal text or even wrote into different lines.) and an acronym is references as this ?[ACME]. The definition of ?[ACME] should be apart in the same way as the bibliography.

When we talk about code, we use the f(function_name) format. This help us to detect the function names.
